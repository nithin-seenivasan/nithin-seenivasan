## Apps on Google Play Store:
- [STT - Simple Teaching Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stt.private_teaching_tracker "STT - Simple Teaching Tracker"): A simple data collection app for teachers giving private lessons to multiple students. Once the teacher has created a profile for each student, they can press the button "I'm teaching", and the app registers all the relevant information in a local SQFlite database. A monthly summary containing all information about the lessons can be generated as PDF for each student. Source code is [here](https://github.com/nithin-seenivasan/STT-Simple-Teaching-Tracker "here"), feel free to fork or use the code for your own projects!
- [GroceryViz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=grocery.viz "GroceryViz"): A grocery analysis app that uses Flutter for the frontend with a combination of cloud services such as OCR (Amazon's AWS Textract), Serverless computing (AWS Lambda running Python code), NoSQL DB (AWS DynamoDB), GraphQL based messaging (AWS AppSync) as well as cloud based user authentication (AWS Cognito), for the backend. The app's user data is obtained from digital purchase receipts (PNG format) from the loyalty program app ("Lidl Plus") of the supermarket Lidl. Uploading the receipt runs a cloud based workflow and results in a simple graphical analysis of the grocery purchase
