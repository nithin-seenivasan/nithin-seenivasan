- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nithin-seenivasan and I'm a real person not a NinjaCat!  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things Tech! I love how technology can be used to improve people's lives and make society better for all
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to make responsive apps (for Android/iOS/web) with AWS and Azure backends
- :computer: I've built multiple apps for work and for myself, and this repo contains some of my hobby Flutter and Python projects
- :file_folder: My app on Google Play Store [GroceryViz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=grocery.viz, "GroceryViz") is a Grocery analysis app that uses   Flutter for the frontend and combination of OCR (using Amazon's AWS Textract), Serverless computing (using AWS Lambda running Python scripts), NoSQL DB (using AWS DynamoDB), GraphQL based messaging (using AWS AppSync) as well as cloud based user authentication, for the backend. The app's source data is based on the supermarket Lidl's loyalty program "Lidl Plus". 
- :briefcase: [Current project](https://github.com/nithin-seenivasan/STT-Simple-Teaching-Tracker, "Simple Teaching Tracker") that I'm working on is a Student Tracking app for teachers giving private lessons. The repo contains a working Android version, and the iOS port is under development.
